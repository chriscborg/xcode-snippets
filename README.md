# Xcode Snippets

My list of user snippets for iOS App Development using Xcode. List will be growing gradually, but it mainly contain constant snippets that requires a Google Search to do.

These files would need to be stored under `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/CodeSnippets/` on macOS 

Snippets available:

* Activity Indicator setup
* Alerts
* Completion handlers
* URL Post requests
* Web View setup and delegates
